## 🐛 Known Limitations (MVP Phase)

1. **No Backend** - Data only in browser, not synced across devices
2. **Mock Data** - Courses, careers, pathways are hardcoded samples
3. **No Real AI** - Recommendations are static, not personalized yet
4. **Basic Profiles** - Can't edit education/experience yet (only view)
5. **No Email Verification** - Anyone can create account with any email
6. **No Password Reset** - If you forget password, no recovery option

These are intentional for MVP and will be added in Phase 2!
